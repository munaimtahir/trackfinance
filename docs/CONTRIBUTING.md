# Contributing

This project is primarily maintained by a single human owner and an AI developer agent.

- Keep commits small and descriptive.
- Update tests and docs with behavior changes.
- Do not commit secrets (.env, google-services.json, etc.).
- Use Issues and the provided templates to track tasks and bugs.

For AI agents:
- Reference `docs/FinalAIDeveloperPrompt.md` before making large changes.
- Keep the codebase consistent and tidy.
